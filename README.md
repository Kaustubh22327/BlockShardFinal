## 🔍 About BlockShard

BlockShard is a decentralized platform for secure and scalable file sharing and storage. By leveraging blockchain technology and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), BlockShard offers a tamper-resistant, reliable, and user-friendly solution to securely store and access files. This project aims to provide an alternative to traditional cloud storage solutions with enhanced data privacy, decentralization, and security.

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Decentralized Storage**: Files are stored across a distributed network, reducing dependency on centralized servers.
- 🔐 **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain integration ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized tampering.
- 📦 **IPFS Integration**: Files are stored and retrieved through IPFS, allowing for efficient and scalable file management.
- 🔒 **Data Encryption**: Ensures that files are accessible only to authorized users.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, IPFS, Web3
- **Database**: IPFS, Blockchain for immutability and storage

## 📥 Installation

To set up BlockShard locally:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kaustubh22327/BlockShardFinal.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd BlockShardFinal
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Upload File**: Select a file to upload securely to the decentralized network.
2. **Retrieve File**: Use the file’s unique ID or hash to retrieve it anytime, from anywhere. 
3. **File Sharing**: Share files securely with others by providing the file’s unique ID.

## 🏗 System Architecture

BlockShard leverages a combination of IPFS for decentralized storage and blockchain for transaction integrity. Here’s a simplified workflow:
1. **File Upload** ➡️ File is encrypted and stored on IPFS.
2. **File Hash on Blockchain** ➡️ The file's unique IPFS hash is saved on the blockchain for data verification.
3. **File Retrieval** ➡️ Users can access files using the IPFS hash, verified by the blockchain for authenticity.
